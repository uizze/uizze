# Stop Making UI Slop

Build product-specific UI with four free skills and, when useful, focused
references from [UIZZE](https://uizze.com).

## Install a skill

Use `ui-design` as the broad design and implementation workflow:

```bash
npx skills add https://uizze.com --skill ui-design
```

Use `anti-ui-slop` when the task is specifically about preventing or reviewing
generic UI:

```bash
npx skills add https://uizze.com --skill anti-ui-slop
```

The skills work without an account, token, script, or MCP connection. The
domain packages are canonical; the four copies in this repository match them
for GitHub-native installers.

## Connect the paid MCP

Create an agent token in [UIZZE](https://uizze.com), keep it out of source
control, and connect the authenticated endpoint:

```bash
export UIZZE_AGENT_TOKEN="uizze_at_your_token"
codex mcp add uizze --url https://uizze.com/mcp --bearer-token-env-var UIZZE_AGENT_TOKEN
```

The MCP intentionally exposes two tools:

- `find_ui_references` — find or inspect up to three full-screen references.
- `find_ui_materials` — find up to three hosted fonts, icons, animated icons,
  or explicitly requested packs.

No result is a valid result. Agents should continue with the product's existing
system instead of retrying or inventing advice.

## GitHub Action

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: uizze/uizze@v1
```

The action performs a conservative source check on the GitHub runner. It does
not upload source or replace visual, accessibility, security, or usability
review. See [integrations/github-action](integrations/github-action).
